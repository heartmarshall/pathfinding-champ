# Path Champ
 
Path Champ is the environment for conducting competitions in artificial intelligence for pathfinding.

Participants of the competition write code for agents that compete on a shared map.
The host of the competition assigns new tasks to the agents and monitors their performance. 
During the competition, the agents "improve" by learning to report more information about 
the world to the competitors.
